# Python Stock Price Analysis
## This is a small project I create to show different plots in python and how to use them to analyze data.
### Please use Jupyter notebook to run the code, and set up as the comment line as separate cells
### You also need to install missing packages as you see in import statement, and as well as pandas-datareader (pip install pandas-datareader)
### All historical data are come from quandl dataset. I have provided the API key for demonstration purpose. Please register your own account to setup using your own API key (Please see comment in python code file).
